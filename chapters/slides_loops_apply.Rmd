# Control Structures: `for`-loops

For loops iterate over values from a vector, e.g. `1:3`:

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
}
```

They are most commonly used for iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc.):

```{r}
x = 5
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  x[i] = x[i]*2
}
print(x)
```

# Apply Functions to Columns/Rows

`apply` calls a function on rows or columns of a `data.frame` and always returns a vector.

```{r }
d = data.frame(col1 = c(1,1,2), col2 = c(2,2,3))
d
apply(d, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean) # all row means
apply(d, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean) # all col means
```
