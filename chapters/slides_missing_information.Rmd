# `NA`, `NaN` and `NULL`

In other situations we have to show the absence of information.
`NA`, `NaN` and `NULL` can all be seen as a representation of "nothing", but the 
reason for the missing information is different:

`NA`:
: Missing observation, improper conversion, ...

`NaN`:
: Numerical problem occured, `0 / 0`, `log(-1)`, etc. Often followed by a 
  warning message.

`NULL`:
: The `NULL` object. Object with no reference value, i.e., absence of an object.

# `is.na` and `is.null`

Often it is required to check if a variable is `NA` or `NULL`. But a logical 
comparison with `NA` or `NULL` results in:

```{r, size = "tiny"}
age = NA    # assign NA to age, i.e., unknown age
age == NA

dec32 = NULL  # assign NULL to dec32
dec32 == NULL
```

Instead of a logical comparison use the functions `is.na` and `is.null`:

```{r, size = "tiny"}
is.na(age)
is.null(dec32)
```
